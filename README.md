This repo holds codes of the paper: MSTFNet: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Fusion Network with Hierarchical Feature Alignment for Continuous Sign Language Recognition

This repo is based on [VAC (ICCV 2021)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Min_Visual_Alignment_Constraint_for_Continuous_Sign_Language_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html). Many thanks for their great work!


## Prerequisites

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (better >=1.13 to be compatible with ctcdecode or these may exist errors). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)，for beam search decode. (ctcdecode is only supported on the Linux platform.)

- [Optional] sclite [[kaldi-asr/kaldi]](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi), install kaldi tool to get sclite for evaluation. After installation, create a soft link toward the sclite: 
  `mkdir ./software`
  `ln -s PATH_TO_KALDI/tools/sctk-2.4.10/bin/sclite ./software/sclite`

   You may use the python version evaluation tool for convenience (by setting 'evaluate_tool' as 'python' in line 16 of ./configs/baseline.yaml), but sclite can provide more detailed statistics.

- You can install other required modules by conducting 
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Implementation
The implementation for the CorrNet (line 18) is given in [./modules/resnet.py](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/CorrNet_CSLR/blob/main/modules/resnet.py).  

It's then equipped with the BasicBlock in ResNet in line 58 [./modules/resnet.py](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/CorrNet_CSLR/blob/main/modules/resnet.py).

We later found that the Identification Module with only spatial decomposition could perform on par with what we report in the paper (spatial-temporal decomposition) and is slighter faster, and thus implement it as such.

## Data Preparation
You can choose any one of following datasets to verify the effectiveness of CorrNet.

### PHOENIX2014 dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX/). Our experiments based on phoenix-2014.v3.tar.gz.

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/phoenix2014-release ./dataset/phoenix2014`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

### PHOENIX2014-T dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/PHOENIX-2014-T-release-v3/PHOENIX-2014-T ./dataset/phoenix2014-T`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess-T.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

If you get an error like ```IndexError: list index out of range``` on the PHOENIX2014-T dataset, you may refer to [this issue](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/CorrNet/issues/10#issuecomment-1660363025) to tackle the problem.

### CSL dataset

1. Request the CSL Dataset from this website [[download link]](https://ustc-slr.github.io/openresources/cslr-dataset-2015/index.html)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET ./dataset/CSL`

3. The original image sequence is 1280x720, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess-CSL.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ``` 

### CSL-Daily dataset

1. Request the CSL-Daily Dataset from this website [[download link]](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zhouh156/dataset/csl-daily/)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET ./dataset/CSL-Daily`

3. The original image sequence is 1280x720, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess-CSL-Daily.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ``` 



​	To evaluate the pretrained model, choose the dataset from phoenix2014/phoenix2014-T/CSL/CSL-Daily in line 3 in ./config/baseline.yaml first, and run the command below：   
`python main.py --config ./config/baseline.yaml --device your_device --load-weights path_to_weight.pt --phase test`

### Training

The priorities of configuration files are: command line > config file > default values of argparse. To train the SLR model, run the command below:

`python main.py --config ./config/baseline.yaml --device your_device`

Note that you can choose the target dataset from phoenix2014/phoenix2014-T/CSL/CSL-Daily in line 3 in ./config/baseline.yaml.
 
For CSL-Daily dataset, You may choose to reduce the lr by half from 0.0001 to 0.00005, change the lr deacying rate (gamma in the 'optimizer.py') from 0.2 to 0.5, and disable the temporal resampling strategy (comment line 121 in dataloader_video.py).

### Visualizations
For Grad-CAM visualization, you can replace the resnet.py under "./modules" with the resnet.py under "./weight_map_generation", and then run ```python generate_cam.py``` with your own hyperparameters.

### Test with one video input
Except performing inference on datasets, we provide a `test_one_video.py` to perform inference with only one video input. An example command is 

`python test_one_video.py --model_path /path_to_pretrained_weights --video_path /path_to_your_video --device your_device`

The `video_path` can be the path to a video file or a dir contains extracted images from a video.

Acceptable paramters:
- `model_path`, the path to pretrained weights.
- `video_path`, the path to a video file or a dir contains extracted images from a video.
- `device`, which device to run inference, default=0.
- `language`, the target sign language, default='phoenix', choices=['phoenix', 'csl'].
- `max_frames_num`, the max input frames sampled from an input video, default=360.
